    <h2>A simple (yet effective) appetizer!</h2>
    <p>What could be more simple than a Wrap? And what could be also so yummy as a classic BLT? The short answer: <strong>nothing</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bacon</li>
            <li>1 head butter lettuce, leaves roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 small ripe tomatoes, sliced</li>
            <li>6 large burrito-size tortilla wraps</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the easy chive mayo:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayo</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh chives</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375˚F.</li>
            <li>Arrange the bacon on a few baking sheets with foil or elevate them on a wire rack, making sure the bacon is not overlapping.

                Bake the bacon for 15-20 minutes until it’s browned and crispy. Then remove the bacon from the baking sheet and let it drain on a few paper towels.</li>

            <li>In a medium bowl combine the mayo, chives, lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread about 2 tablespoons of the chive mayo onto your wrap. Then layer with butter lettuce, tomato slices, followed by 3-4 strips of crispy bacon. 

                Fold the edges over on the wrap and roll it into a tight cylinder. Cut the wrap in half for easier eating.
                
                Continue until all wraps are assembled.</li>
            <li>Roll the wrap tightly in foil and keep it in the fridge until you leave. I like to pack the wraps in a bag with a cold pack, but they are fine wrapped up for a few hours also. I think the wrap is best when the lettuce is nice and crispy and cold. 

                Wrap ingredients all keep well in the fridge for 1 week. Make wraps on the day you are eating them!</li>
        </ol>
